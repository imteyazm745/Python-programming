Variable:  
A variable is basically nothing but the name of a memory location that we use for storing data. We can change the value of a variable in C or any other language, and we can also reuse it multiple times.

Creating a Variable:  
checkingAccount = 500
savingsAccount = 1000

# add 100 to our savings (Yeah!)
savingsAccount = savingsAccount + 100

# remove 50 from our checkingaccount (Sniff)
checkingAccount = checkingAccount - 50

# calculate the number of days to save to reach 5000
numberDaysSave = (5000 - checkingAccount) / 500

# update our checkingaccount (again) after the daily gains/losses
checkingAccount = checkingAccount + (30 - 10) * 7
Lines starting with a # are comments. They are used to document your code and help others understand it.
The other lines of code (which can run operations, declarations, etc.) are expressions. They tell the computer what to do.
each of the expressions assigns a value to a variable. The assignment operator is   = .
To the right of the assignment operator is the expression that will create/calculate a value.
To the left of the assignment operator, you write the name of the variable to which you will assign the corresponding value.
